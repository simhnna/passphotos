# Passphoto generator

This is a simple website that takes a photo of a person and generates a passport photo with the correct dimensions for use in official german documents.

There's a live version of this website available at [https://passbilder.pages.dev/](https://passbilder.pages.dev/).

The image is handled locally in the browser and is _not_ uploaded to any server.
In case of errors during generation the error, image dimensions and the parameters used for generation are sent to a server for debugging purposes.
